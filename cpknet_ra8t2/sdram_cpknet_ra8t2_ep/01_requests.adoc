=== CPKNET-RA8T2 32bit SDRAM sample code with speed test

Priority: 01

* Hardware: CPKNET-RA8T2 core board only
* FSP: 6.2.0
* BSP: CPKNET-RA8T2 (no additional setting)
* BSP Excel Sheet: default (no additional setting)

This sample code should achieve: 

. Function: AM initialization
. Benchmark: Show SDRAM data throughput in different configuration

***
==== Functions: 
Target(s): Initialize and confirm SDRAM working +
Result(s): Show each function's execution result: OK / NG
----
1. 32bit SDRAM initialization
2. Full memory Write, then full memory read and compare
    Write: CPU -> Non-Cached SDRAM  
    Read: Non-Cached SDRAM -> CPU
    32bit access, patten 
        0x5A5A5A5A
        0xA5A5A5A5
        0x5A5A5A5A
        0xA5A5A5A5
         ...
        (repeat)

***
==== Benchmarks: 
Target(s): show SDRAM data throughput in different configuration +
Result(s): Show each test's result in MB/second
----
1. Read speed test (64K bytes random data, with 8bit/16bit/32bit access)
    1.1 CPU: Cached SDRAM -> D-TCM
    1.2 CPU: Non-Cached SDRAM -> D-TCM
    1.3 DMA: SDRAM -> D-TCM
2. Write speed test (64K bytes random data, with 8bit/16bit/32bit access)
    2.1 CPU: D-TCM -> Non-Cached SDRAM
    2.2 CPU: D-TCM -> Cached SDRAM (Write Through)
    2.3 CPU: D-TCM -> Cached SDRAM (Write Back, with flush at the end of write operation)
    2.4 DMA: D-TCM -> SDRAM
